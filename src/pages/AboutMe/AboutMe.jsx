            <h4>
                Hi, I'm Thiesa, a passionate web developer from Brazil.
            </h4>
            <p>
                My journey into web development started when I enrolled in <a href="https://programaria.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PrograMaria</a>, a web development course designed to teach, inspire, and create opportunities for women in technology. I instantly fell in love with the world of coding.
            </p>
            <p>
                What excites me the most about web development is the opportunity to solve problems, much like the puzzle games I enjoy.
                Witnessing each step of a project coming together brings me immense satisfaction.
                Although I'm leaning towards backend development, my skills include Python, Node.js, React.js, and MYSQL.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my time at Trybe, where I'll graduate in March 2024, I've had the privilege of working on numerous projects,
                gaining hands-on experience and overcoming challenges along the way.
            </p>
            <p>
                My philosophy centers around continuous learning, quality work, building meaningful connections, and enjoying the problem-solving process. I believe in making the most of every opportunity to learn and grow.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I excel in teamwork and collaboration, I also value personal interests. Beyond coding, I find joy in playing puzzle and co-op games, dancing, and spending time with my dog.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I continue to evolve in the field, my goal is to absorb as much knowledge as possible and contribute to projects that make a positive impact.
