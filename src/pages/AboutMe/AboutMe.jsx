            <h4>Hi, I'm Thiesa, a passionate web developer from Brazil. 👩‍💻</h4>
            <p>
                My journey into web development started when I enrolled in <a href="https://programaria.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PrograMaria</a>,
                a tech course empowering women, and I instantly fell in love with coding and the community.
            </p>
            <p>
                Excited by problem-solving, my skills include Python, Node.js, React.js, and MYSQL. 💡
            </p>
            <p>
                Graduating from <a href="https://www.betrybe.com/">Trybe</a> in March 2024, I've tackled diverse projects, valuing continuous learning,
                quality work, and meaningful connections. 🚀
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond coding, I enjoy puzzle games, co-op games, dancing, and spending time with my dog. 🎮🕺🐶
            </p>
            <p>
                Eager to evolve, I aim to contribute to impactful projects. 🌟
